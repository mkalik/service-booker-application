# User-Story:

User side:

When the server is launched then the homepage appears -> then on the homepage we have a login/signup button -> when that button is pressed,  the user is prompted to login or signup within a modal.

When they either login or signup, they are brought to their profile page -> this page will display their current request tickets as well as have a tab that will take them to their previous tickets

When tickets are displayed, there will be an additional button on them ( a cancel button ) that will allow a user to delete a ticket.

There will also be another link that will allow for them to create a new ticket -> if this link is clicked the ticket will prompt the user for their product type, the problem with the product,
budget for the repairs, contact info( potentially , may just be embedded within user info).

(if we have time) Employee side:

They will have elevated privileges and they will be able to see all tickets generated-> they will be able to click on a ticket in order to close it, view it, or respond to the ticket request.->

from there they will be able to send out an email to the user.
